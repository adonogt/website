      <p>
        i'm gustavo adono, an embedded systems engineer from brazil focused on precision and simplicity.
        inspired by japanese philosophy — the concept of "ma" (negative space),
        the pursuit of "kaizen" (continuous improvement), and the respect embedded in "monozukuri" (craftsmanship) —
        i approach technology as a practice that requires both technical skill and thoughtful intent.
